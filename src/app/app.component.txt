notes while watching the codenation tutorial on routing

=================================================================

it not like we always create a new app using routing option , we can add the routing by doing the few steps
1st -> go to index.html and add <base href="/">; below the title tag.
2nd -> create a new file app-routing.module.ts ( copy the basic code from google).
3rd -> import the AppRoutingModule in app.module.ts and also add it inside the import array.
4th -> create the 2 new component employee-list and department-list
